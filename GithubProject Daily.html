It was a lot of content but I managed to keep going through my constant reminder of becoming a full time software engineer. I had to be hungry for it, nothing will stop me as long as I have the mindset and consistency! Until then!

                           After being sick since Sunday, I've been feeling alot better. As a result, I'll probably put a few extra hours in just to catch up the work that I've missed out on when I was sick. I was still doing work that time but not as much as I wanted to because of my flu. Until then!

Hopefully I'll give it my all but I know for certain that I'll get stuck in a few parts (Mainly the JavaScript aspect, that stuff is pretty difficult). But nevertheless, until then!

I still feel a bit sick, and that's probably becuse I went to work out. I thought I'd already recovered but I guess not; maybe even slow my recovery down. Shit. But whatever man, I can still code regardless so until then!

                           I had to take a break for two days because I was extremely frustrated with the way I've been working with APIs. Spending hours and pulling my hair out on debugging errors. Today I'm going to give it a try again with a more optimistic mindset
